Feature Extraction</a>\nWe can not use text directly to train our models. We need to convert it in the form of features, only then it can be used to train any model for desired outcome and we know very well that most of the models respond to the numeric features very well. So we need to bring all these text representations in the form of numbers.\n\nThere are two popular approaches to extract features from texts: \n1. Count the number of occurrece of each word in a document. \n2. Calculate the frequency of each word occurrence out of all word in a document.\n\nFew most commonly used techniqus to perform feature extraction are:<br/>\n**1. Bag of Words**<br/>\n**2.

Bag of Words</a>\nBag of words is one of the simplest approaches of feature extraction, here we simply keep the frequency count of all unique words and consider it as a feature. Example: \n\nSuppose we have below sentences (also referred as documents):\n\n> 1. Must have a subject and a verb.\n> 2. Must express a complete thought.\n> 3. Must only have one clause.\n\nFeature extraction we need to perform are:\n\n**1. Identify Unique words**\n    Unique words from all documents are:\n    **must, have, a, subject, and, verb, express, complete, thought, only, one, clause**\n    \n**2. Perform Vectorization**\n    we need to find the frequency count of each unique word and if it is not there then we need to put 0. For eg vector for first document can be formed as: \n\n> must - 1 <br/>\n> have - 1 <br/>\n> subject - 1 <br/>\n> and - 1 <br/>\n> verb - 1 <br/>\n> express - 0 <br/>\n> complete - 0 <br/>\n> thought - 0 <br/>\n> only - 0 <br/>\n> one - 0 <br/>\n> clause - 0 <br/>\n\nSo, it will become\n> 1. [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nsimilar way doucument2 and document3 will become:\n> 2. [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n> 3.
